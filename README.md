# vmquack-binja-plugin
Here's the Binary Ninja plugin I made for the vmquack reversing challenge I wrote for corCTF 2021.
The architecture plugin probably isn't completely accurate, but hopefully this can be a helpful reference point for those who would like to write custom architecture plugins.
Feel free to give the challenge (the vmquack file) a shot, check out the plugin on the "pcode.dump" file which has the vm data and vm text segments dumped for parsing, or give the corresponding writeup a read [here](https://www.willsroot.io/2021/08/corctf-2021-vmquack-writeup-writing.html).
