# vmquack-binja-plugin
Here's the Binary Ninja plugin I made for the vmquack reversing challenge I wrote for corCTF 2021.
The architecture plugin probably isn't completely accurate, but hopefully this can be a helpful reference point.
Feel free to give the challenge (the vmquack file) a shot as well, or check out the plugin the "pcode.dump" file which has the vm data and vm text segments dumped for the plugin to parse.
